# Regular Expressions (RegEx) Tutorial

For this tutorial, I will be explaining what a Regular Expression (RegEx for short) is all about, and how it is used to verify a search term. A regular expression (or RegEx) is a series of characters which define a specific search pattern. 

## Summary

I will be covering and breaking down what forms a Regex component that is used to match email values. 

Matching email:
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/
